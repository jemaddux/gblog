Another gSchool week down and we have finished up reading Eloquent Ruby part III. The third section is all about metaprogramming: what it is and how to use it. So far metaprogramming looks interesting but not very useful to me currently. It looks like the kind of code that will cause lots of unexpected errors if I use it wrong and doesn't do much to make the code work when and where I want it to. It seems like it will be exceedingly useful once I get the hang of it but that for right now fooling around with it to much will just mean that things constantly break. However that just seems to be the price of learning how to use it.         
             
As for the book, it has taught me a good bit about Ruby that I didn't know before reading it and I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn Ruby. However, I would tell them that they are unlikely to get everything in it the first or second time through the book. Several of the chapters need to be read and practiced before the lessons will really sink in.
