The second part of the Passionate Programmer continues with the books overarching message that you are now responsible for your programming career much more than at any time in the past. Not only do you have to be the one to continue your training and firgure out what new technologies to explore and to dive into but you also need make sure that the marketplace knows what you are doing and how that is valuable to them. The book talks about how we can prepare ourselves for the new skills we will need in the front half of the book while in the latter half it goes over the marketing. One thing that I think that it does well is that it really makes the case for marketing yourself even before it tells you how you should go about it. The case is that nobody knows what you do, why you do it or how you do it unless you tell them. You could be the best programmer in the world but if noone knows about you then noone will hire you. The book goes into how you need to not only do good work but that you must communicate well with others what you are doing and how that is important to them or else they will have no reason to hire you.

The techinque that I would choose from this book is blogging. I think that aside from the publicity that you can get from blogging about different programming issues you can also learn lots this way. It also seems a bit easier to get started in than public speaking or writing a full book but that it could lead to either one of these types of engagments.
