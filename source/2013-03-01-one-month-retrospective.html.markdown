We are one month into gSchool now and we are starting to build our first app that will go live on the web. It is called Traffic Spy and it is a Google Analytics clone that will respond to some Javascript from another page to log and track activity on other websites. I'm glad that we are moving onto building web applications because we are getting closer to the really cool web apps that I want to be building. So far we have been doing tons of ruby command line programs and api-like programs that respond to other programs. That has taught us lots about how to properly construct programs in Ruby and how those kinds of programs are important. It also shows us a side of web development I hadn't thought about before coming here (which is an important part of web development) but I am still glad to be starting on something that will respond in my web browser.     

As for all the people that I have met here I am surprised to find out how much pair programming we have ended up doing and how much that has helped the learning process. I expected more individual coding time and less learning from my peers but I have found that working with someone else has made the whole coding process faster. We have to talk out what we are trying to implement which prevents simple mistakes and speeds up the process of writing good significantly.           

Also it seems that next Monday we will being doing our first individual skills evaluation where we will go over our strengths and weaknesses. As to what I think my strengths and weaknesses are I would start with my programming style as a weakness. I think that I still try to make a big procedural programming type program instead of starting out thinking in a object oriented manner. I tend to write my code to just get it to work rather than asking if I am implementing this bit of code in the right part of the program. I think this makes the coding more difficult because it leaves me with fewer parts of the code that are reusable and with code full of bloated methods. As to strengths I think that I am picking up everything quickly and implementing new ideas into my code well. Many of the concepts that we are learning (like HTTP) are not entirely new to me. I might have heard of them before so when we are learning how they work it usually builds upon a vague idea that I already had. This can also feed into being a weakness though as a big part of the reason that my Ruby coding style is off what it should be is because that is how I coded when I was teaching Ruby to myself without anyone to show exactly why I shouldn't be doing it that way.         

I guess my resolution for the next month should be to try and clean up my style to deal with my weakness. I think that having clear and concise code will speed up my web development and help my learning process the most.
