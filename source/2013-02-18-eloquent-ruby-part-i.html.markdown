This week at gSchool we started reading Eloquent Ruby; a book which attempts to school the new ruby programmer in the correct way to write Ruby. The author goes through the correct way to implement several Ruby features as well as going over the way that most of the community uses Ruby and structures their programs to keep them clean and clear.      

The thing that really helped me out the most were the staying out of trouble sections. I felt that these areas were helping keep the reader away from areas where they could cause themselves trouble if they don't know what they are doing. A thing that I found in the staying out of trouble section that I think might be affecting the program that I am working on now (SalesEngine) was that ruby objects are mutable and I need to make sure that I don't create dependencies where they shouldn't be in the code.     

Eloquent Ruby also talks about regular expressions and how they work. For the uninitiated regular expressions are a bunch of of letters, number and symbols that are used to find a certain pattern inside of strings and extract them. They are a powerful tool if you can use them but until now I had been leaving them alone in favor of other techniques but there are some things that they can be very useful for if you know how to work them. After reading through Eloquent Ruby they are more approachable and that I understand them at least a little now.
