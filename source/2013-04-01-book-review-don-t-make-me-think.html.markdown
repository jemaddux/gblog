  This week for gSchool we read the first half of Steve Krug’s book “Don’t Make Me Think.” It is a classic of web design but it still contains lots of important design tips for the aspiring web designer/developer. 
  Most of the first half of the book could be simplified down to “keep it simple” but to think it is just that would be oversimplifying this book. Each chapter has specific tips on how to remove cruft and make the whole experience easier and more enjoyable for the user. 
  My favorite was chapter 6, “Street signs and Breadcrumbs” which covered how users think about navigation on the web and how that navigation differs from navigation in the real world. In the real world people have to physically move through space to get where they want to go while on the web the experience is more akin to teleporting everywhere. Since the user is moving around via hyperlinks they need to be shown where they are at all times or they can get lost within your site. His method for this is making sure that all site pages have what he calls street signs and breadcrumbs. 
  Breadcrumbs are an idea lifted from the story of Hansel and Gretel where  the breadcrumbs are used to show where the children came from as they walked deeper into the woods. At the end of the story they were able to follow them to find their way back. The same can be true on the web where users can get lost and can use breadcrumbs (which he implements as a line of links that show the users path on the site navigation) to find what they were looking for before. 
  The other navigation tip Steve talks about is signposts. Using signpost means that you should structure titles, headers and navigation on the site so that the user can clearly see what part of the website they are in. 
  Both of these tips and many of the other tips in the book are helpful because they let me see the webpage through fresh eyes. Sometimes designers and developers can get so technically proficient with web technologies that it is hard to remember how most people view the web (and a little bit more simplicity never hurt).
