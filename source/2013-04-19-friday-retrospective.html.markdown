In this Friday retrospective I answer some questions on how the program has been going so far:

####Son of Store Engine – what went right? What went wrong? Why? What things will you do the same on your next project and what will you do differently?

Next time I will use faker first to generate a bunch of data from the get go. Big data sites need to be handled differently than small sites. They need to be split up a lot more so that they don’t overwhelm the server or take too long to load up. What went wrong with our site was that it was super slow. It was hanging in the demo (it was probably still generating the faker data) and even later when it had calmed down it was still taking four seconds to load some of the pages. That is way too long. The site also had quite a few bugs all around it that I wasn’t really happy with that would have been caught by more thorough feature testing.

####Organization – how are you keeping track of what you need to do on a given day? How do you decide to divide time between project work, reading, lightning talks, and personal learning?

I just sorta split my time between them while giving more time to project work. I get the project work done while I am at gSchool but with the other stuff I just leave it until I get home and go through it at a bit more relaxed pace. I never been a huge project planner so I mostly use Pivotal Tracker as a way to see what has been done and what needs to be done.

####Halfway – As of today we’re halfway done. How does that make you feel? What do you think the next three months will be like? Do you feel like your momentum is building or slowing? What can you do to affect your outcomes in July?

Halfway done with this course and I can’t wait to see what else we learn in the next three months. I feel like the program is still picking up pace and that we are having to learn more as we go along and we are expected to be able to handle increasingly large and complicated projects. As for affecting what I end up with in July I can work on mastering the skills at hand and growing the number of open source projects that I work on to include projects hosted by companies I may want to work for in the future.
