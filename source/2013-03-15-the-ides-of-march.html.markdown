This week I got my first app that I have created up on the web. It is called JetFuel and it is a Bit.ly clone. You can go to <a href="http://jetfuel.herokuapp.com">Jetfuel.herokuapp.com</a> and insert a link and then JetFuel will shorten it and give you back the new link that will redirect you the the same site. Building it was a good lesson in combining a database, Sinatra and a bit of HTML/CSS to make a functional and (reasonably) good looking app. It even has a party piece: the top bar changes to a random color every time you load the page or click on it.
