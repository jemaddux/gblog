Imagine a website where you can schedule runs with your buddies and then see the results of the run afterwards. Imagine that you can follow your friends and see how much and where they have been running. Imagine you could do all of this without having to use the same run tracking app. That is what my team is building on this project iteration.

The nice thing about this project is that I don't know of anything like it out on the web and it seems like something that people would actually want to use. The project development is also moving smoothly even though this is a longer project than normal we have all had practice working together now and can do so smoothly.

This project is longer than the ones we have done before and that is especially obvious to me this time because I'm starting to think of the project as three weeks of the ten weeks we have left here at gSchool. The lingering questions surrounding getting a job at the end of the program are starting to become more pertinent. I would like to work with a diverse and opinionated group of people with opportunities to take on hard challenges all over the technology stack including learning new things that we haven;t had the time to cover at gSchool. As for how to know when I have found that fit? I am still not entirely sure.
