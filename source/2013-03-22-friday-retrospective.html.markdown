This week I answer some retrospective questions about how gSchool is going so far and I talk about what I have learned.  

#####What do you think about Rails so far? Thereâ€™s a tradeoff between doing everything yourself with Sinatra versus the on-the-surface simplicity of Rails. Which makes you more comfortable? Which do you think is more productive in the short-term? Long-term?

So far Rails seems like it does a bunch of the work for you where Sinatra doesn't. It probably moves you along faster in terms of getting your whole project setup but, in return, means that Rails designs your app in its way, not in your way. However, I don't really see that as a downside. Using the standard setup gets you up and running faster and if you need to change something later you still can. Unless, you know that you are going a very different direction from the start the Rails option seems easier to me as well as seeming more productive in both the short and long run.

#####What was your favorite part of the week? Least favorite?
  
Best thing this week was working on building Blogger. Given I also worked on building the Contact app but with the Contact app we used lots of scaffolding where in Blogger we just used rails generate. I think that breaking what was happening down into smaller pieces and seeing how it unfolded gave me a better idea about what was happening than simply using scaffolding.

#####If you could schedule one guest speaker to talk with the class, who would it be and why?

My first thought was Paul Graham since I have read almost every one of his essays. My second thought was Peter Thiel as I have recently been reading through the class notes on his class he gave on entrepreneurship. Both of them have such interesting ways of thinking and have very insightful ideas about what it means to create a tech startup that I think they would be very interesting guests. Not that gSchool is a startup school but I am sure that the idea of creating a startup has crossed most of our minds.
