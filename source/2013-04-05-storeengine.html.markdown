We just finished our Store Engine project (see ours at <a href="http://oregonsale.herokuapp.com">oregonsale.herokuapp.com</a>) and it was a fairly new and different experience than the other projects that I have worked on. 

The first difference was that we read the first half of "Don’t Make Me Think" before we started the site. "Don’t Make Me Think" had a big influence on the way that I approached the layout of the site. I put in as much stuff as I normally would but in the end I simplified everything that I did down to the essentials and I think that made for a much better site than if I had left lots of what I now realize was garbage laying around. 

Another difference is that Store Engine was a fairly complex project and it was the first Rails project that we teamed up for. We started my designing the front end of the store which gave us all a good idea of where we were headed with the project. It also let us sorta fill in the code on something that was already designed even if the css wasn't written for it. Thing is that we just designed the front page rather than going through and designing every page so when it came to the functionality of some of the admin pages or pages nested under an admin page we found ourselves making it up as we went along and many times hacking together a solution. I do like that designing the front page first let us get an overall view for the store and helped us create a consistent design for the store from the begining but I think maybe a bit more design upfront is needed to make it clear where we are headed. 

Working in a larger team means for more communication and more difficult communication (even moving from two to three people). It becomes easier to miss something than when you and the other person are sitting beside each other and constantly glancing at each others screens. I think that in teams it is more important to setup good communication early on than almost anything else including having a plan for the project. The project will evolve and change. The plan will be different every single day so worrying too much about it in the beginning at the cost of establishing good communication will mean that you pay the price in terms of being able to change the plan and interate on that plan later.

It is hard to be sure with only one three person team to judge by but I think that adding one person simply made us one person more productive. I don't think that the productivity of any one person went down by being part of a bigger team. The cost instead was the rigidity of the plan from start to finish. I think that our plan was well thought out and well executed but if we had found a major flaw in our original plan then it would have meant lots of lost time while we sat down and came up with a new plan that now takes everything into account.
