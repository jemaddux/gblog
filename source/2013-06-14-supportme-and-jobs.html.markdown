Services Project
How’s it feel to be back in a group? Did you learn any lessons working on your own that you’re now bringing through the group?
Do you feel like you’re understanding the concept of services? What makes sense and what’s still confusing?
Have you dug into using websockets with Faye? How has it gone so far?

Job Hunt
How’s the job hunt going? Have you applied for jobs? Interviewed? Any lessons learned?
What are your next steps to finding a great job?
What things have you observed, from shadowing or guest speakers, that appeal to you about companies? What things have turned you off?
