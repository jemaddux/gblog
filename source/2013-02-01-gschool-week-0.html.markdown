Words to paper.   
This week:   
  -we did some improv   
  -we made a micro blogger and Paul and I proved we barely know how Twitter works when we had coded the direct messages correctly but didn't know where to find it on the page and thought that we had done it incorrectly   
  -team Frostbite went on a scavenger hunt against the other gSchool teams and managed to reach 8 of the 13 stops before bravely giving up and going to the bar   
  -we worked on the event manager program, which is still unfinished and due on Monday   
  -we met up with some of the tech startups from in the office and around the city
  -hmmmmmmmm.........
