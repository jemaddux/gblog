Coding is fun. -----  If you don't think so then you should try it.   

There are lots of great sites out there to teach you the basics and I have worked through a couple of them. However they all lack one thing. Live teachers who can help you along.   	

This is why I came to gSchool. In the first week here I have learned much more than I would have if was just trying to teach myself to code. Don't get me wrong. Codecademy, Codeschool, Udacity and many other websites out there can teach you a great deal about how to code. However, books and websites can't replace actual teachers (like Franklin and Jeff) who can set you tasks to improve your skills and show what you are doing wrong when needed. Working with my other classmates has been awesome too. For example earlier this week Paul and I were pair coding a program that interacts with Twitter and we coded part of it to send direct messages at our followers. We spent about 20 minutes wondering why we couldn't see the messages being sent. We asked another group if they could see what we were doing wrong and they showed us where the direct messages are on the site. We have coded it right but we didn't use Twitter enough to know where the messages were showing up. Ooops! Anyway we got it done and it works great now.   

Other stuff we did this week. We got to socialize some when we went on a scavenger hunt around Denver to find local sites and other points of interest. My team named ourselves Frostbite and managed to get to 8 of the 13 points before bravely giving up and going to the bar. We also met with some of the tech companies in and around the Galvanize building at a social last thursday.

All in all a good first week!
