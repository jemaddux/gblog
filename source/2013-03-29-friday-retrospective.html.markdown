This Friday for my gSchool blog I answer some questions about this week at gSchool:

#####What’s the most confusing component of Rails? Why? Could it be simpler, or is it just solving a difficult problem?
      
None of the components of Rails seem too difficult after you learn how to use them. They do have their own way of doing things but for that small sacrifice you get all the power and simplicity that they bring without any major drawbacks as far as I have seen. After hand coding many of the solutions that Rails offers as standard I won't complain about it.
      
#####What did you think about the increased emphasis on pairing this week? Was it productive for you? Why or why not? What’s challenging when you’re pairing, and what’s easier?

I like pairing sometimes adn I certainly like having someone else in the group who I can ask to look at my code when I am stuck. Sometimes the fresh set of eyes will be able to sort out a problem because they can see something simple that you are overlooking while other times explaining the problem to someone else give you enough perspective to see what the problem is. The challenging part of pair can be what part of the problem to break off at any time. If we are trying to pair on big tests it seems like we will be biting off more than we can chew during any one hour pairing session. 

#####How do you feel about acceptance testing after Joseph’s talk Wednesday? Does your application make good use of acceptance tests?

Acceptance testing seems like another necessary part of a whole testing suite. They, of course, make sure that even if your unit tests are working that the whole site isn't down and thus that you are delivering the value you think your site is. It also means that You can do this necessary testing automatically and without wasting too much of your own valuable time.

#####This is your first project working in groups larger than two. Do you feel like your progress is moving faster? If so, how much faster? What’s been fun and what’s been challenging about a larger group?

I think that we talk about decisions more so that part of the project takes longer. However I also think that the increase in communication doesn't slow us down overall since we have another developer and we get more done each day. It is kind of amazing seeing the site coming together while knowing which parts I built and which parts my teammates built. The whole site is coming together much faster than if only one or two people were working on it.

#####What should we expect to see in your demo Thursday? Will it be amazing, decent, or crap?

I think that my team's demo next Thursday will impress. Without giving the whole game away I can say that we have added a good number of impressive visual elements as well as having solid code that makes for a fast and responsive website.
