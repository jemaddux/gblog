This week we started reading "The Passionate Programmer," a book that focuses on helping programmers make the most of their career by offering them a series of tips on how to make the most of their opportunities. I've put the spotlight on a few of them below by answering a few questions about them:

__Question 1: Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?__   
Tip 30: Say No   
Saying yes when you should be saying no or saying maybe is one of the biggest problems that I have always encountered (and of course contributed to). There is only so much time and energy that any person or company has to give and not biting off more than you can chew is just as important as taking on difficult tasks that will stretch your abilities. I think that this is pretty obvious but is also something we should all hear from time to time because we want to please people but we forget that we actually just cause more trouble in the long run.

__Question 2: Was there a tip that you disagreed with? How/why?__  
Tip  26: A Pebble in a Bucket of Water      
It isn't that I disagree with the idea that you should make your code as maintainable as possible. You should definitely do that. What I disagree with is that one person in a business can't make a difference that would be noticed if they left. I think that one person can be very important to a company. However the book is certainly right that the way to do this isn't to make it unusable or unintelligible as possible. The path to being the person that is a boulder in the bucket rather than the pebble in the bucket is the other tips suggested in this book. Even if your never reach that level of importance it is good to work down that path to be the best that you can.   

__Question 3: Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?__   
Tip 31: Don't Panic    
This is one that I know internally but never seems to be something I think about. Also something that I only do about half as often as I should. It is something that is hard to pull off since the unknown always scares us so I think that the only way to really learn it is to desensitize yourself to the panic. It is like learning to be brave, you can only be brave when you are scared so the only way to do it is to things that can scare you. I think that pushing yourself in not just on your skills but in what you feel comfortable with is a very important part of any self growth.        

__Question 4: Which tip would be the hardest for you to implement and why? What systems/support can you use to make it work?__   
Tip 12: Learn How Businesses Really Work.    
I like this tip. I really do and I think that if you work inside a company and don't have an overview of how the different parts of it works then you are doing yourself a disservice. The problem that I see with this tip is how overwhelming it really can be. I think it is a fairly big task to just get a hand on the dynamics of whatever company you are in right now. To get a bigger view of businesses in general is a much harder task. I am not a huge fan of the book they recommended but I do like the idea of talking to someone else in your company about how the financials work. This will give you a good start on where you can help with your talents. The thing is that how ever much as much any class, book or reading the Wall Street Journal will teach you they won't prepare you for the uncertainty that always surrounds any business decisions. Only starting a business will teach you that. Of course this isn't an option for everyone, especially if you already have a job. I think that the best way to learn the business side is to find business related tasks that you can do in small amounts of independent time without actually causing problems if it doesn't work. Try writing up a marketing piece or figuring out how a real company's 10k statement (which can be found on the website of most publicly traded companies) and see what you learn. Before to long you should have a much better view of how the insides of a business works.
